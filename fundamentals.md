# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals

## 🔹 History of Linux

- **Created by:** Linus Torvalds in **1991**, inspired by UNIX and MINIX.
- Initially made as a personal project to build a free operating system kernel.
- **Kernel:** The core of the OS that interacts directly with hardware.
- **Shell:** Acts as an interface between user and kernel.
- **Open Source:** Anyone can view, edit, and share the code.
- **Community-driven:** Maintained by thousands of developers worldwide.
- **Mascot:** A penguin named **Tux**, representing Linux.

## 🔹 Linux Distributions (Distros)

A **Linux distribution** = Linux Kernel + System Utilities + Software Packages + Package Manager + Desktop Environment.

Each distro is tailored for different needs — servers, desktops, development, or security.

- Always up-to-date with new features.
- Uses `.rpm` and **DNF** package manager.
- Great for developers who want bleeding-edge software.

#### 🟢 Linux Mint
- Based on Ubuntu and Debian.
- Comes with multimedia codecs and preinstalled tools.
